# Smart Agricultural Bot: AI & ML, IoT, and Drone-Based Agricultural Assistant (Aid to Farmers)

## Introduction

Agriculture is the backbone of all economies in the world. Without agriculture and farming, the world wouldnâ€™t exist. All our food, clothes, and even medicines begin with the fields. Despite farmers being crucial for human survival, they are not treated with respect, support, and the resources they deserve.

In many regions, farmers struggle with very low income due to crops being sold for low prices, unpredictable weather, and crop loss due to floods and weeds. In India alone, nearly 112,000 farmer suicides have been reported over the past 10 years.

This is because farmers are not able to access modern technology. They need access to technology that allows them to check soil fertility, water supply, predict temperature changes, and climate from a mobile device. With the help of our project that uses drones, sensors, AI, and mobility, tasks like fertilizing, watering, and monitoring can be automated to improve productivity. Data is analyzed through the cloud.

Our goal is to develop a solution that brings this technology directly to farmers, empowering them with a technological aid to work smarter and protect their crops, leading to a better livelihood.

## Project Overview

This smart agricultural bot is designed to help farmers in their daily work by automating major tasks in agriculture and providing them with real-time data.

### RC car in Mobility
The project uses an RC car to move around the field and collect data. This helps to cover a large area at low cost without placing systems near all plants.

### ESP32 AI camera
The AI-powered camera identifies crops, weeds, and animals. Using the YOLO model, it helps prevent crop damage and supports better crop growth.

### Retractable shelter
The shelter is controlled through IoT using a raindrop sensor to protect crops from rain.

### Drone
The drone helps with irrigation, spraying fertilizer, and monitoring the fields using computer vision. It is a multifunctional and cost-efficient tool.

### Sensor Integration
The bot includes various sensors:  
- Soil moisture sensor to monitor water needs  
- Temperature sensor to track atmospheric conditions  
- Light level sensor to check sunlight for photosynthesis  
- Rain drop sensor to control the shelter  

## IoT and AI Cloud

IoT helps collect data from all components and supports decision-making. It stores and analyzes data through the AI cloud, providing reports on crop growth, water use, etc. Farmers can control the bot and access data through a mobile app, even from a remote location. The system sends alerts if it detects problems like low water or animal presence.

## Power

The project uses renewable energy sources such as solar, hydroelectricity, and geothermal energy to reduce carbon emissions and conserve resources.

## Farmer App Dashboard

This app helps farmers monitor, control, and receive data from the fields. It is user-friendly and suitable for farmers with limited tech knowledge. Notifications and alerts are sent through the app.

## Smart Irrigation System

The system uses real-time data to automate irrigation and reduce water waste.

### Method 1: Drip Irrigation
Water is supplied through pipes based on inputs from sensors.

### Method 2: Drone-based Irrigation
The drone sprays water or fertilizer over the plants using IoT control.

## Environmental Impact

This project supports:  
- Improved crop yields (SDG 2)  
- Water conservation (SDG 6)  
- Reduced chemical use (SDG 12)  
- Efficient resource management (SDG 12)  
- Soil conservation (SDG 15)  
- Innovation in agriculture (SDG 9)  

## Mission and Vision

**Mission:** Create a technologically advanced farming system to protect crops and improve yield.  
**Vision:** Enable farmers to monitor crops and perform tasks with the help of IoT and automation.

## Conclusion

The Smart Agricultural Bot helps farmers by automating key tasks like watering, monitoring, and pest control using AI, IoT, and green energy. It supports environmental protection and boosts productivity. With real-time data and mobile access, it makes technology available to farmers in a sustainable way.
